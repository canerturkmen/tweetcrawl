## tweetcrawl

![build status](https://api.travis-ci.org/canerturkmen/tweetcrawl.png "build status")

tweetcrawl is intented as a twitter user, status and follow links crawler that links with Twitter over python-twitter and stores information in a MongoDB instance.

Currently, the project is a stub and crawl scheduling will be added in order to manage the rate limits enforced by Twitter.

The github repo lacks a `config.py` file which defines some globals necessary for running the project. If you'd like to build, just contact me over **github** or [e-mail](mailto:turkmen.ac@gmail.com) me.
